    <p>This was my entry to Jump Jam 2022. I got sick with covid about halfway into the allotted time (I think it was like 10-12 days to make a map) so I was definitely low effort mapping, but I still managed to produce something pretty good. I went with generic recolours of happygonk textures and a nice skybox to substitute lack of actual detailing. It's 18 jumps long and fairly straightforward pogo with tele connectors. It ended up winning the demo category for the Jam. </p>
    <p>Azazel has 1bonus, which features slant walls with playerclip over it at a steeper angle. This has the effect of increasing playerclip depth depending on how high up on the slant you are. Sadly this turned into a bounce airpogo wr. </p>
