    <h2>T6 Demo | T2 Soldier</h2>
    <p>After playing sj_ironmoon and sj_naissance by Brae, I really wanted to make some kind of spooky edgy map with an abstract style. Daeva didn't turn out exactly how I envisioned as the detailing was honestly lackluster in many areas. I think between hammer nuking all my jurf ramps and visibility issues due to everything being open to other parts of map, I got a bit frustrated with things not working and just wanted to be done. Very happy though with fitting 2 skyboxes into a map, and ripping the halloween spell rune texture and recolouring it.</p>
    <p>Daeva is yet another 8 jump map that is a combination of phase and airpogo. It's a fairly easy T6 except for last, which is kinda rough. The gameplay is alright, though in some areas I definitely could've made it more interesting. I implemented a soldier route to turn the whole map into a linear jurf map pretty much, and it was fun to play n people seemed to enjoy that route.</p>
    <p>Daeva has 4 bonuses and they are all very Rat. I wanted to see just how much garbage I could put into one bonus, so B1 is wallbug wiggle -> seamshot button (on demo its a plinko machine type deal) -> catapulted into a psycho strafe  ceiling smash bhop -> terrible small ramp low speed surf around corner -> intended edgebug (can skip) -> end. No idea why Gorge zoned this. B2 is funny as it's a player sized gap horizontally with a player sized hole vertically at the back. Very simply but really hard. B3 is boring it's just jump 7 backwards as requested by Waldo. B4 is last but really tiny. </p>
